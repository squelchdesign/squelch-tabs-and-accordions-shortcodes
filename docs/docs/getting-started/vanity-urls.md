# Vanity URLs

**Vanity URLs** are an extension to Magic URLs. By default a magic URL will add a `#squelch-taas-` to the page address. e.g.

```
https://example.com/#squelch-taas-accordion-shortcode-content-1
```

You have the option to adjust the text to reflect your own branding, or to make it a little shorter, by changing the **Vanity URL prefix** in the Customizer.

1. Go to the **Customizer** (Appearance > Customize)
1. Click the **Tabs and Accordions** menu item in the sidebar
1. Edit the value of the **Vanity URL prefix** box
1. Click **Publish** at the top of the sidebar to save your changes

When you return to the front end of the site and click a tab, accordion, toggle, or horizontal accordion, you should see your newly chosen Vanity URL appear in the page address. Remember though that any old magic URLs will stop working if you change the vanity URL prefix!

:::info[Previewing your changes]

The WordPress Customizer doesn't show the page address as you navigate around your site, so whilst the **Vanity URL** setting is changed within the Customizer, you won't be able to see the change until you publish your changes and then navigate to the front end of your website.
