# Changing the theme

Out of the box Squelch Tabs and Accordions uses the Smoothness theme, which is an unobtrusive grey theme. But there are other options available:

* 24 jQuery UI themes to choose from shipped with the plugin,
* a mostly blank theme that web designers can style to match their site's theme,
* no styles at all to prevent conflicting with any other jQuery UI theme that has been loaded elsewhere within your site or by another plugin,
* and the option to roll your own jQuery UI theme.

Changing themes is straightforward:

1. Go to the **Customizer** (Appearance > Customize)
1. Click the **Tabs and Accordions** menu item in the sidebar
1. Choose a different theme from the **Theme for tabs and accordions** dropdown
1. Click **Publish** at the top of the sidebar to save your changes once you are satisfied with your choice

As the customizer provides a live preview of your changes the right hand screen you can simply navigate to a page that has an element provided by **Squelch Tabs and Accordions** and you will be able to see the theme changes updating immediately within the live preview.

Be sure to navigate to a page that has an element built by Squelch Tabs and Accordions in the right hand panel of the Customizer in order to be able to see your changes!
