# Changing the theme

Out of the box Squelch Tabs and Accordions uses the Smoothness theme, which is an unobtrusive grey theme. But there are other options available: Squelch Tabs and Accordions ships with 24 themes to choose from, as well as a mostly blank theme that web designers can style to match their site's theme, and there is also an option to load no styles at all to prevent conflicting with any other jQuery UI theme that has been loaded elsewhere within your site or by another plugin. There is more information on this in the developer section.

Changing themes is straightforward:

1. Go to the **Customizer** (Appearance > Customize)
1. Click the **Tabs and Accordions** menu item in the sidebar
1. Choose a different theme from the **Theme for tabs and accordions** dropdown
1. Click **Publish** at the top of the sidebar to save your changes once you are satisfied with your choice

As the customizer provides a live preview of your changes the right hand screen you can simply navigate to a page that has an element provided by **Squelch Tabs and Accordions** and you will be able to see the theme changes updating immediately within the live preview.
