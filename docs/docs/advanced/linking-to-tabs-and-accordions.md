# Linking to tabs and accordions

Since version 0.3.7 it has been possible to link to tabs and accordions on your website. The easiest way to achieve this is to open the tab you want to link to and, if you take a look at the page address, it should change as you click the tab. If you copy and paste this address it should link directly to the tab you have chosen.

If you want to link to a tab, accordion, toggle, or horizontal accordion **on the same page** you can use just the part of the URL that begins with a hash (#). e.g. If you have this URL:

`https://example.com/about-us/#squelch-taas-toggle-shortcode-content-2`

You can trim away everything except for:

`#squelch-taas-toggle-shortcode-content-2`

Then this can be used as the link address in your new link.
